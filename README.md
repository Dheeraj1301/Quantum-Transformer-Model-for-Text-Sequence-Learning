## 🧠 How It Helps Google Quantum AI & Research

Google Quantum AI is advancing quantum hardware (Sycamore, Bristlecone) and quantum error correction. This model supports:

- **Quantum compiler research:** Automatically learns optimized gate sequences.
- **Hardware-aware optimization:** Models trained on noisy circuit data can generalize to better gate scheduling.
- **Experimental fidelity enhancement:** High-fidelity transformations make it easier to run algorithms on NISQ devices.
- **Data-driven error mitigation:** Predicts circuits that reduce noise propagation and decoherence.

> This framework can be extended to optimize quantum circuits for Google's quantum hardware constraints using custom datasets.

```bash

tensorboard --logdir=runs
```
✅ Visualize results in Streamlit:
```bash

streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```
### This dashboard displays:

Loss curves

Fidelity improvement over epochs

Gate depth minimization

Inference time tracking

### 🔄 Model Workflow (Step-by-Step)
➤ 1. Dataset Preparation
Circuits are tokenized into a numerical format representing quantum gates.

Labels are either optimal sequences (sequence task) or gate-wise tags (token task).

➤ 2. Transformer Model
Embeds tokenized circuits.

Processes them through self-attention layers.

Outputs optimized gate sequences or per-token predictions.

➤ 3. Loss & Training
Uses CrossEntropyLoss.

Fidelity and gate depth are calculated on predictions vs. true labels.

Backpropagation optimizes the model to:

Maximize fidelity

Minimize depth

Maintain speed

➤ 4. Evaluation Metrics
Fidelity: Measures how similar the optimized circuit is to the ideal circuit (1 = perfect).

Gate Depth: Lower gate depth = faster and less error-prone execution.

Inference Time: Time to output optimized circuit (important for real-time use).

➤ 5. Saving Results
Logs are saved for TensorBoard.

Final model saved to checkpoints/tqco_model.pt.

### 📊 Results Interpretation
Metric	Meaning
Loss	Measures how well predictions match expected optimized circuits
Fidelity	> 0.9 = excellent, shows strong circuit similarity
Gate Depth	Lower is better; implies fewer layers needed for execution
Inference Time	< 0.01s = usable for live optimization pipelines

These results can be compared across epochs to measure training improvements.

### 🔬 Research Use Cases
Quantum compiler optimization: Train models to learn compiler strategies (e.g., Qiskit transpiler alternatives).

Quantum VQE acceleration: Optimize ansatz circuits for lower hardware costs.

Quantum RL bootstrapping: Use model as a policy generator for reinforcement learning agents.

Pre-training for QML models: Use as an encoder for larger quantum learning pipelines.

### 🧯 Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
CUDA out of memory	Reduce batch_size, use num_layers=2
Model not learning	Try lr=1e-3 temporarily or increase dropout if overfitting
NaNs in loss or fidelity	Add gradient clipping (clip_grad_norm_), use torch.autocast for FP16
Streamlit not launching	Run pip install streamlit or downgrade to streamlit==1.21.0
Accuracy remains low	Check dataset quality, try token-level supervision
